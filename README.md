## About The Project
![](images/Breakfast%20Garden.png)

This is a basic landing page for a fake breakfast restaurant. This project was to test out my designing abilities so it isn't interactive.

The main purposes for this project were:
* Testing out front-end design
* Making a site mobile friendly with use of media queries
* Make a design in attempt to catch user's attention
* I'm pretty sure I was hungry and wanted breakfast...

If you want to contact me about my basic pancake webpage and maybe discuss why you believe waffles are better. (Pancakes are #1)
